My favourite food is Masala Dosa. I like it most when my mom makes it, as they are crispy, savory, and I can have them with all sorts of delicious fillings like red chilli paste, potato masala and also other recipes but i like it with chicken gravy. And i can eat them at all times it doesn't matter the time for me.
